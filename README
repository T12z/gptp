This a fork of Intel's gptp daemon from the AVnu project.

I am trying to forward the time on a best effort / least corrupting basis into a bare-metal Jailhouse inmate. I mean, the most precise way would be to assign a NIC to that JH inmate. However, there are many arguments, why you may not want to do that: implementation complexity, safety regulations, security concerns, etc. And the resulting time accuracy uncertainty may be the lesser problem. Let's see where we can get with this.

Note, the modificaions rely on the Invariant-TSC feature of modern x86_64 processors. In principle, it could be implemented for other architectures as well, I just did not do it.

The corresponding Jailhouse inmate 'nollie' can be found in the nanostw repository.
